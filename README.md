# The Sad Tale of EIC - Insurance Dashboard in Power BI

This project explores the story of EIC, a once-prominent motor insurance company that operated between 2014 and 2018. Despite having a strong customer base, EIC faced increasing losses year after year and ultimately shut down in 2019. Using Power BI, this analysis uncovers the financial trends, claim patterns, and segment performances that led to its collapse.

## Project Overview

The analysis aims to answer key questions such as:

- Were premiums sufficient to cover the claims?
- Which customer segments contributed to the most claims?
- Were there any areas of profitability at all?
- How did EIC’s performance vary over the years?

---

## Key Insights

- EIC collected $4B in premiums but paid out $9.2B in claims.
- The average Premium-to-Claim ratio was only 44%, far below sustainability.
- Only one profitable quarter was observed - Q2 of 2018.
- Most policies were sold for motorcycles and trucks.
- Agricultural segments, although small in volume, delivered the highest profitability.
